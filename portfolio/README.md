Salesforce Licencing module, from the Salesforce Trailhead earning platform

I created the Salesforce Licensing module on the Salesforce Trailhead learning platform to provide a comprehensive and accessible explanation of licensing and user enablement for Salesforce admins, developers, and general users. Unit 2 of the 3-unit tutorial is included here, explaining permissions, preferences, and profiles, and how they integrate with licenses to enable user access.
